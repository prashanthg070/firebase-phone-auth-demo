        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 2, 2026</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Firebase Phone Auth Demo uses your phone number solely for authentication purposes. We do not sell, share, or use your data for advertising. Your privacy and security are our top priorities.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Firebase Phone Auth Demo ("we," "our," or "the app"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your personal information when you use our mobile application. By using Firebase Phone Auth Demo, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
        </p>
        
        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <h3>2.1 Phone Number</h3>
        <p>
            We collect and process your phone number for authentication purposes. This is the primary piece of personal information our app requires to function. Your phone number is collected when you:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the instant carrier-based verification feature</li>
            <li>Enter your phone number for SMS verification</li>
            <li>Complete the authentication process</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2.2 Authentication Data</h3>
        <p>
            We collect authentication tokens and session information generated by Firebase Authentication to maintain your logged-in state and provide secure access to the application.
        </p>
        
        <h3>2.3 Device Information</h3>
        <p>
            We may collect basic device information such as device model, operating system version, and app version for troubleshooting and improving app performance.
        </p>
        
        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
            We use the collected information exclusively for the following purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> To verify your identity and create a secure authenticated session</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> To protect your account from unauthorized access</li>
            <li><strong>Service Delivery:</strong> To provide you with the core functionality of the application</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Support:</strong> To diagnose and resolve technical issues you may encounter</li>
            <li><strong>App Improvement:</strong> To understand how the app is used and improve its features and performance</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> We do NOT use your phone number or any other data for advertising, marketing, profiling, or any purpose other than authentication and improving the app's core functionality.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>4. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        
        <h3>4.1 Firebase Services</h3>
        <p>
            Your phone number is processed through Firebase Authentication and Firebase Phone Number Verification services, which are provided by Google LLC. These services are used solely to verify your phone number and create your authenticated session. Firebase operates under Google's privacy policies and security standards.
        </p>
        
        <h3>4.2 No Third-Party Sharing</h3>
        <p>
            We do NOT sell, rent, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties. We do not share your data with:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data brokers or information resellers</li>
            <li>Advertising networks or marketing companies</li>
            <li>Analytics services for user profiling</li>
            <li>Any third party for purposes unrelated to authentication</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>4.3 Legal Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or government agency).
        </p>
        
        <h2>5. How We Store and Protect Your Information</h2>
        
        <h3>5.1 Data Security</h3>
        <p>
            We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your personal information:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>All data transmission is encrypted using TLS/SSL protocols</li>
            <li>Phone numbers are stored securely in Firebase's infrastructure with encryption at rest</li>
            <li>Access to user data is restricted and logged</li>
            <li>We follow Firebase and Google Cloud security best practices</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>5.2 Data Storage Location</h3>
        <p>
            Your data is stored on Firebase's secure cloud infrastructure, which is hosted on Google Cloud Platform. Firebase automatically replicates data across multiple geographic regions for reliability and disaster recovery.
        </p>
        
        <h2>6. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        
        <h3>6.1 Retention Period</h3>
        <p>
            We retain your phone number and authentication data for as long as your account remains active. This allows you to use the app without re-authenticating every time.
        </p>
        
        <h3>6.2 Data Deletion</h3>
        <p>
            You have the right to request deletion of your personal information at any time. To delete your data:

            <li>Contact us at <a href="mailto:support@example.com">support@example.com</a> to request complete account deletion</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Upon receiving a deletion request, we will delete your personal information within 30 days, except where retention is required by law.
        </p>
        
        <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>

            <li><strong>Correction:</strong> You can request correction of inaccurate information</li>
